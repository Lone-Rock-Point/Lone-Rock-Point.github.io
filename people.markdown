## How We Work
You work at LRP because you have shown to be self-motivated, responsible, and professional.
### Remote
We are a remote team. This affords us the opportunity to configure our environments and schedules to provide the best results for our team and clients. Remote work is not without challenges. Talk with your manager if you need help navigating issues working remotely.

While your schedule is yours, there will be LRP and client meetings during "normal" US timezone hours. In addition, you and your team will greatly benefit from overlapping work schedules.

### Communication 
It would be impossible to keep up with all communications in all communication channels. Prioritize communications for the project(s) you are working on and LRP/HR communications. Some client projects will have communication requirements beyond our internal systems. Adjust your notifications in a way that works for you. 

Keep in mind that your calendar is a communication tool as well - please keep it up to date.

### Time Tracking

Some clients require time tracking and some do not. If you are required to track time for a project you will be shown how to do so. It is important that you accurately capture the work you have performed.

## Ceremonies
This section is about the normal events that may take place throughout the year and their purpose. Ceremonies sounds formal and rituals sounds like some kind of weird cult thing...but whatever.

### Annual Reviews

The annual review process is an opportunity to receive feedback directly from management and colleauges. You will be expected to review yourself and your manager. You may also be asked to review other colleagues. Following the writing of reviews you will have a meeting with HR to distill the reviews.

### 1:1 Meetings

1:1 meetings are good opportunity to check-in regularly with your manager and/or reports. If you are having regular 1:1s the annual review process should be easier. 

You should schedule a 1:1 with your manager at a regular cadence. Once a month or every other week seem to work for most folks. However, you do NOT need to wait for a 1:1 to raise concerns. 

### Pair Programming
Pair programming is an opportunity for two developers to solve a problem together. Generally, there is a driver and navigator. The role of the driver is to write code - this is the developer that will be sharing their screen. The navigator is helping review code real-time for logic/syntax as well as thinking ahead about next steps. 

Pair programming is extremely helpful in any stage of your career. If you are more junior than the developer you are pairing with there are tons of learning opportunities. If you are a the more senior developer navigating is a great way to understand what opportunities a junior developer might need to improve their craft.

## Tools
This is a short summary of the tools we use at LRP.

### Slack
Most of our daily conversation takes place in slack. If you are working, please be on slack. If you are heads-down please set your status to Do Not Disturb (DND). You do not have to reply immediately, slack is asynchronous. However, understand that your colleageus may be waiting for an answer from you. 

Slack is on 24/7 but you are not working 24/7. Make sure to configure your notifications appropriately. 

Slack communications can become hard to find in history - so if you are discussing something that needs to be referred to in the future, capture it somewhere else.

### Google Workspace
LRP uses Google Workspace. This provides email, documents, spreadsheets, slides, and a video chat. Make sure to check your LRP email regularly. Any docs you work on within LRP will likely start within Google Workspace

### Gusto
Payroll and PTO take place in gusto.
